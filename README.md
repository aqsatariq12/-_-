                                              TITLE : JAVA PROGRAMMING INTERNSHIP - CODE ALPHA

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my Java programming internship with Code Alpha. Throughout this internship, I worked on real-world projects that helped me strengthen my Java programming skills, especially in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

a) Projects Overview:

1. STUDENT GRADE TRACKER
A console-based Java application that allows teachers to track and manage student grades.

Features:
Input and store grades for multiple students.
Calculate and display the average, highest, and lowest scores.

Concepts used:
Data handling with arrays and ArrayLists.
Methods for calculating statistics (average, max, min).

2. SIMPLE BANKING APPLICATION
A basic banking system that allows users to perform simple transactions.

Features:
Deposit and withdraw money.
Check balance.
Error handling for invalid transactions.

Concepts used:
Encapsulation and data protection.
Exception handling.
User input and validation.

3. HOTEL RESERVATION SYSTEM
A Java program that simulates a hotel room booking system.

Features:
Book rooms and manage reservations.
Check room availability and pricing.

Concepts used:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes and inheritance.

b) Technologies Used:

Java SE (Standard Edition)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

c) Conclusion:

Each of these projects helped me gain practical experience in Java development, focusing on problem-solving, OOP concepts, and building functional applications. I'm excited to continue applying these skills in future projects!
